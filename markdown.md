```
git checkout master
```

Create a new file called `markdown.MD` and experiment with writing some markdown.
When you have written something, add it to the repository, commit the change, and
then push to the GitHub cloud repository, e.g.

```
git add markdown.MD
git commit -a
git push
```

Using your web browser, take a look at your `markdown.MD` rendered in GitHub.
